## ðŸ“Œ What is Secure Notes?  
Secure Notes are encrypted digital notes that store sensitive information, such as passwords, personal data, or confidential details. They use encryption (e.g., AES-256) to protect data from unauthorized access and often require authentication (password, biometrics, or multi-factor authentication) for access. Secure Notes are commonly found in password managers and secure storage apps.
